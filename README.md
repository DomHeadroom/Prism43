### Project Discontinued
This tool is no longer functional starting from **Prism Launcher version 10**.

**Reason:**
Since the v10 update, the launcher performs a mandatory **token check** every time an instance is launched.

---

### Usage (Legacy - Only for versions < 10):
- Install Prism Launcher
- Go through the setup
- Close the launcher
- Run the following command in terminal:
```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomHeadroom/Prism43/main/prism43.sh)
